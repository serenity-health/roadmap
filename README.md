# Serenity Roadmap

Thank you for the interest in Serenity and our products!
This is the public roadmap for Serenity Products and Services (Provider, Corporate, Patient and system apps). Also, it's inspired by Docker's roadmap. Shouts to the Docker team!

# Introduction
We want to share with our customers what we plan to do early and often so we can get your feedback on if these are the right things for us to be focusing on. This also allows our customers to make early decisions based on what we are/are not building. 

[See the roadmap »](https://github.com/orgs/serenity-health/projects/1)


**Security and privacy**  
Please do not create a public github issue for concerns regarding application security and privacy. If you discover a potential security issue in a serenity application we ask that you notify our support team by sending your report privately to support@serenity.health. Please do not create a public github issue.


# FAQs

**Q:** What do the roadmap categories mean?
* Shipped - Hopefully you are enjoying it! Give us feedback on how it is working!
* Almost There - We are applying the finishing touches. Things in this bucket you can expect to be shipped within 1-2 weeks
* We're Writing the Code - Actively in development, we are trying to get this out to you in a good state as soon as we can.
* Investigating - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented! We'd love to see your usecase or design ideas here.
* Backlog - We know this issue exists but haven't started working on it just yet

**Q:** Why are there no dates on your roadmap?

**A:** Because we know things change and we want the room to do the right thing by fixing security issues as they come up or helping people out where they need. This means we might have to change our priorities and don’t want to let people down. 

**Q:** How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?

**A:** Please open an issue in this repo! If the issue is a bug or security issue, send an email to support@serenity.health instead

**Q:** How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?

**A:** Please open an issue! Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.
